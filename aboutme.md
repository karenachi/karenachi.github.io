My name is Karen Achi. 

- I'm a creative person, I enjoy finding the perfect solution for the people I care about.
- I'm very passionate and can pursue my ideals with a single-mindedness that may catch others off guard.
- I generally aim to use my strengths for the greater good – I am rarely enjoying succeeding at other people’s expense. 
- I mostly stand up for what's right and want to help create a world where others do the right thing as well.
- I can be reserved but I value deep, authentic relationships with others, and I tend to take great care with other people’s feelings.
- I find myself feeling especially stressed in the face of conflict and criticism.
- I feel compelled to find a mission for my life.
