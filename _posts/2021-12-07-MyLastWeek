In my last week, I've learned how to use the different tools of "Github" and I've created a website ( this one ). Not only GitHub now will help me create websites, it will also allow me and others to collaborate on projects from any location so I can learn different technical skills from these people.

Finally, I've been working on a 5 minutes presentation for "The SUSE Women in Technology Early Career Mentorship Program Finale!". Before presenting it in front of all the members, I have been given a chance to try it with my mentor who gave me some helpful feedback and tips.
