The mentorship program was lunched on Saturday, October 2nd at 9:30 AM PT/5:30 PM BST. It was a "speed networking" kickoff meeting where we met the mentors and spent a few minutes talking with them to see if there was a spark of a connection. The strategy used was the breakout rooms in Zoom of 10 minutes each. From my point of view, it was fun meeting with many people from different countries and each one of them had a specific type of conversations, so it was a mixed up of many subjects in only one hour. 

After that, we were sent an attached powerpoint with the rounds, in case we needed to remember some names. In addition to that, we had to complete a form in order to be paired
with a mentor we liked talking to. 

Our second meeting was on Saturday, October 9th at 10 AM PT/6 PM BST, where we, mentees, met only with the representors of this mentorship and learned about how we can
start communicating with our mentor. We were given a guide to follow up optionally in case we get lost somewhere. 

One day later, I was paired with a mentor who was in the same domain of education as I am. I reached out to her by sending an email and we finished by scheduling a 
recurring meeting every week, according to our available day and time.
