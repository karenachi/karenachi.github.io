**Programs/Interships**

My mentor informed me about many programs I can participate in, in order to increase my skills and experiences for my future.

The Google Summer Of Code (GSOC) : open source participants will spend the summer writing code for an open source organization while being mentored by members of their new                                      open source community. In addition, it is an activity where a participant performs as an independent developer for which he/she is paid a                                      stipend.

Outreachy : provides open source internships to those affected by systemic bias and underrepresentation in the technical industry where they reside. Interns at Outreachy work             with seasoned mentors from the open source community. Programming, user experience, documentation, graphical design, data science, marketing, user advocacy, and               community event planning are examples of outreachy internship tasks.

**SUSE Meetings**

During this mentorship, I joined a SUSE meeting online ( Release Engineering Meeting ) where I've seen how corporate and professional meetings occur. In addition, my mentor shared links with me for different kind of meetings recorded in case I was interested to learn more about these public talks. 

**My Personality**

One other think I've learned the most in this mentorship is how my personality can affect my decisions in the real world. I have passed a 16-personalities and it turned out I have an Advocate personality. ( You can find more about it in the "about me" page ).

**Goals Of My Career**

By setting goals in my life, this mentorship let me realize that they will help me organize my time and my resources so that I can make the most of my life. It will also help me raise my self-confidence , as recognize my own ability and competence in achieving the goals that I've set. 
Now, to achieve these goals, I have been given 4 tips : Define my fears instead of my goals , Banish the word â€œfine" , Approach my obstacles with curiosity , and embrace my near wins.

**Profesionnal Communications**

It's still important to be able to communicate professionally and with dignity and respect. Mouthing off and displaying your anger, becoming agitated, or naming someone you disagree with by name on social media may be trendy among some leaders, but it is not appropriate in the workplace. 
Though, in this mentorship I have learned how to communicate proffesionally.

First, I have to think "end" game : Every communication should have a clear goal in mind. If I'm thinking about the overall picture, there's no reason to communicate in a disruptive way. Concentrate on the objective you want to reach and plan your conversation accordingly.

Second, I need to consider my audience : Knowing who I'm speaking to allows me to adapt my remarks to what they already know, understand, and care about. Learn more about them to build a clear communication approach.

Third, I have to create a flow for my information or material : Random facts, incorrect data, and a mess of thoughts or ideas will prevent your audience from understanding all of the aspects you want them to comprehend. Break up your work into sections so that the different components are easy to understand for a listener or reader.

Fourth, I can use stories and context for my listener to make the information relevant to them : Add emotion to your stories to bring them to life, but make sure your emotion isn't directed at degrading or mocking someone. The emotion should be positive and optimistic.

Finally, I have to think long-term : Talk to (and about) others in a courteous manner, and make sure my tone doesn't indicate anger or sarcasm.

**Tell Me About Yourself (TMAY)**

Most of the interviewers nowadays ask this question.
